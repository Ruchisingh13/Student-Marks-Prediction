# Student-Marks-Prediction using Machine Learning 


code run - python app.py

 To predict student marks based on various factors that influence academic performance.

Process:

Data Collection: Gather data including past exam scores, attendance, assignment grades, and other relevant factors.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: Fill in missing data using methods like mean, median, or mode.
Encoding Categorical Data: Convert categorical data into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Normalization: Scale numerical data to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
Feature Selection: Identify and select the most relevant features affecting student performance.

Dataset Splitting: Divide the data into training and testing sets, typically using an 80-20 or 70-30 split.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Neural Networks.

Model Training: Train the chosen model using the training dataset.

Model Evaluation:

Metrics: Use Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's robustness.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters to enhance performance.

Deployment: Implement the model for practical use, allowing predictions on new data.

Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it with new data to maintain accuracy.
